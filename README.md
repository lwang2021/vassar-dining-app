## Authors: Ryan Kilpadi and Ibrahim Farhane

## Status - Prototype (Iteration 2)

## Description
The Vassar Dining app is an improvement on the [Vassar Dining website](https://vassar.cafebonappetit.com/). As well as covering the functionality of the website such as displaying menus and filtering by dietary restrictions, the app will allow the user to favorite items and get notified when they are available, leave reviews, and more.

## Functionality

Currently, the app simply displays mock menu data. It displays menu items, which include descriptions and dietary restrictions, in expandable lists sorted by mealtime. The user is able to select a cafe and a date and the view responds accordingly. When there is no menu to display, a message pops up.
