# Campus Dining App

## Status - Migrating to Jetpack Compose and Kotlin Multiplatform

This app is an improvement on the [Vassar Dining website](https://vassar.cafebonappetit.com/). As well as covering the functionality of the website such as displaying menus and filtering by dietary restrictions, the app will allow the user to favorite items and get notified when they are available, leave reviews, and more.

The app currently has basic Android functionality. The app correctly displays the Vassar menu, and the user can pick and filter favorites and dietary restrictions.
