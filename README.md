# CMPU-203 S23 - Team 2J - Vassar Dining App

## Authors: Ryan Kilpadi and Ibrahim Farhane

## Status - Prototype (Iteration 2)

---

## Description
The Vassar Dining app is an improvement on the [Vassar Dining website](https://vassar.cafebonappetit.com/). As well as covering the functionality of the website such as displaying menus and filtering by dietary restrictions, the app will allow the user to favorite items and get notified when they are available, leave reviews, and more.

Currently, the app exists only in the form of a text-based prototype in Java. It displays mock menu data based on user input and allows the user to add and remove favorites.

## Usage
To run the prototype, select `Controller.java` as the main class and run the application. Then, simply follow the text prompts. Favorite items will persist when a new menu is displayed (marked by a `*`).
