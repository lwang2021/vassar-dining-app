# Iteration 1 Plan

The foundation of this project is viewing the menu. To do this, we will need implement the functionality of the view menu using test data. Allow for changing dining criteria as well as defaulting to the menu at the current time.  

# Iteration 2 Plan

In iteration one, we completed the logic for our `view-menu` and `add-favorite` use cases. Now that the basic structure of our app is done, we need to find a way to parse the XML from the Vassar Dining website. Iteration 2 will mostly involve this as well as using our existing code to create the app in Android Studio. We plan to work on both of these goals concurrently to ensure we have something to present if parsing the XML turns out to be more difficult than anticipated. We will display favorites with a heart icon next to menu items and will add functionality for sorting items by dietary restriction. If we have time, we will create a sidebar where the user can update settings that determine how results are displayed (i.e. should the menu be sorted by favorites? Should it display items that don't meet dietary restrictions?). As a stretch goal, we will also work on our `leave-review` use case in this iteration. 

# Iteration 3 Plan

We did not add favorites functionality in iteration 2. For iteration 3, we should complete that and finish integrating our code that fetches data from BonAppetit into our app. If we have time, we should also add functionality for the user to write reviews. Data persistence is another area to focus on for the next iteration. As a stretch goal, we could implement a database to store our menu data.
